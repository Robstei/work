Generell Information:

 	- logfiles will not be overwritten, instead data will be appended in the 
		case thw subject id was used already
	- amount of circles vary between blocks:
		1. Training Block: 4 circles 
		2. Training Block: 6 circles 

		1. Block: 5 circles 
		2. Block: 4 circles 
		3. Block: 6 circles 
		4. Block: 5 circles 
	- each row describes one stimulus

logfile columns:
	stimulus_position: absolute position of stimulus in the paradigm (trial stimuli are not counted)
	stimulus_type: The numbers 1-4 each represent a sound, while 5 represents circle
	response_time: response time to the stimuli, "-1" if no responses is given
	response_type: 	0 -> HIT 		correct response to a target
			1 -> INCORRECT		wrong response(button) to a target
			2 -> MISS 		subject did not react to a target
			3 -> FALSE_ALARM	subject reacted to a non target
			4 -> OTHER 		subject did not react to a non target

			Due to the nature of the paradigm with the potential of simultaneous response active 
			stimuli it is only possible to track HITs, MISSes, FALS_ALARMs and OTHERs for sounds and not INCORRECTs.
			Circles are always targets so they will only be assosiated with HITs and MISSes and never with FALSE_ALARMs, INCORRECTs or OTHERs.
	condition:Two condition exist
			1 -> sound 1 and sound 2 are targets
			2 -> sound 3 and sound 4 are targets
	block: 	Actual position of the stimulis block.
		There are 4 preconfigured blocks(order of sound stimuli for one block) which will be used in ramdom order.
		Circles will be placed ramdomly between sounds, they can neither be first or last stimuli of a presented block.
		Also there is maximally one circle between 2 sound stimli.
		Circles can not appear 300 ms or closer to a sound stimlus, both prior and after.
		Sounds last 1150 ms, hence after a sound startet a circle can appear erliest at  1450 ms (1150 ms + 300 ms = 1450 ms).
